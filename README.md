### --^ lost3 ^--
I am Lost3 (Lost3#1305 on discord if you wanna add me)

I mod games a lot, and I have some experience with Il2Cpp and too much experience with Mono

No, I will probably not mod a game if you ask me to

### Toro Puzzle revival

I'm working on a revival project of Toro Puzzle (Toro and Friends: Onsen Town for people who don't have it installed) with some other people.

You can check out my work in the [Toro Puzzle hook](https://github.com/lost3o/ToroPuzzle_hook) repo, meanwhile synzr is working on the [servers for it](https://github.com/synzr/puzzle)

### Passions & thoughts

As you can probably tell, I **really** like modding, and I've already decompiled Pixel Gun or just made mods through dnSpy for it a lot of times

Pixel Gun is where most of the Mono experience comes from, I mod versions below 11.4.x because they're Mono, and I'm too lazy to not use LGL for Il2Cpp projects

I really don't like LGL for Il2Cpp, but it's the simplest option I can find. PolarImGUI is just not compact enough and native lib has no real menu for non-automatic features

It's why I'm using LGL for the Toro Puzzle revival, for me it's convenient and I already have enough experience with it to make changes really quickly
