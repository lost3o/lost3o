### --^ lost3 ^--
I am Lost3 (Lost3#1305 on discord if you wanna add me)

I mod games a lot, and I have some experience with Il2Cpp and too much experience with Mono

No, I will probably not mod a game if you ask me to

### Toro Puzzle revival

I'm working on a revival project of Toro Puzzle (Toro and Friends: Onsen Town for people who don't have it installed) with some other people.

You can check out my work in the [Toro Puzzle hook](https://github.com/lost3o/ToroPuzzle_hook) repo, meanwhile synzr is working on the servers for it
